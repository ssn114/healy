        <h2>Why we collect your email</h2>

        Your email address is securely stored using <strong>ConvertKit</strong>, an email service provider
        that helps us manage our waitlist.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        ConvertKit stores your data on secure servers and is required to handle your
        information responsibly.

        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your email address.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Sharing your information</h2>
